# About CHLOE

Cloud Hosting and Learning Optimization Environment (CHLOE), a game-based
training simulation for visual learners. CHLOE's single-player, story-driven
game teaches learners core AWS services, concepts, and best practices, and how
to use the
[AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)
to optimize their cloud workloads. In simulation mode, players can use CHLOE to
render AWS accounts as 3D environments, where they are able to view, launch,
update, and terminate resources in real-time. CHLOE provides contextual training
to solve real-world use cases through audiovisual explanations and tutorials, as
well as animated architecture demonstrations.

The story of CHLOE's game mode starts with a data center incident causing the
player to be stuck inside their company's AWS account. To return to the real
world, the player must rebuild their company's broken applications on AWS using
the Well-Architected Framework. As the player completes levels, they are trained
on various products and services, and given additional learning resources for
later consumption. Players will ultimately beat the game by collecting the
[AWS Well-Architected Pillars](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/the-pillars-of-the-framework.html)
and defeating the antagonist,
[Chaos Monkey](https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/) (a virtual representation
of [Chaos Engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/)).

In game mode, players earn badges by completing tasks, which can be used to
showcase their knowledge to the AWS community. In simulation mode, players can
create 3D architecture environments, or synchronize with their AWS accounts in
real-time. View filters for the Well-Architected Pillars provide feedback on
areas of strength or improvement. Players can use the in-game assistant, CHLOE,
for just-in-time (JIT) training, providing contextual information while
building.

In simulation mode, players can connect to one or more AWS accounts using
federation or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials. Once
connected, players can design solutions in real time and get contextual answers
to complex scenarios. CHLOE can be linked to existing AWS accounts to build
dynamic, 3D architecture diagrams and live workloads in real-time. Players can
enable multiple camera overlays to visualize performance, cost, reliability,
security, and other status information based on the Well-Architected Framework.
Players can troubleshoot resource configuration problems, investigate cost
reduction opportunities, and learn how to optimize infrastructure in a visual,
intuitive manner. If players do not wish to connect CHLOE to their account,
simulation mode can be used to create 3D architecture diagrams for reference and
decision-making.

CHLOE provides just-in-time (JIT) training, giving access to the right
information exactly when a player needs it while configuring their workloads.
Using an in-game assistant named CHLOE, players can get contextual advice and
information related to specific tasks they are performing. Players can request
information in the form of audio/text explanations, streaming video, or in-game
architecture demonstrations.
