# Multiplayer

Initially I was not sure how much interest there was for real-time multiplayer
functionality such as player presence, chat, etc. For multiple players
connecting CHLOE to the same AWS account(s), they are able to utilize the same
resource state data collection infrastructure. Each connected player will have
the same resource data at the same time, effectively allowing multiplayer
interaction.

After initial release, the project team will more deeply investigate multiplayer
benefits and opportunities as a later release.
