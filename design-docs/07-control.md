# Player Control

The user can navigate through the menu/world using standard first-person
controls. The player does not have the ability to jump. Instead they can "fly"
by controlling their vertical elevation.

VR support will be developed in a separate version of the client. Research has
shown that there are concerns around requiring VR hardware, as this introduces
additional cost and complexity. Because of this, players have stated that this
requirement would prohibit their ability to use CHLOE. VR will be supported for
marketing efforts such as conferences and player-scheduled VR training events,
as well as for players with VR-ready hardware.
