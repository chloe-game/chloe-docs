# Game Premise

CHLOE is a cloud training game that makes deeply technical concepts easy to
visualize and understand in a way that entices users to dive deeper and learn
more. CHLOE incorporates characteristics from three categories of
[Game Thinking](https://www.gamified.uk/gamification-framework/differences-between-gamification-and-games/):
gamification, simulation, and serious games.

- **Gamification:** Specifically, CHLOE focuses on **Content Gamification**,
  where game elements, mechanics, and thinking are applied to alter content and
  make it more game-like. This is not to be confused with **Structural
  Gamification**, which applies game elements without alterations to the content
  itself.
- **Simulation:** A virtual representation of something from the real world. In
  the case of CHLOE, it is instead a virtual representation of something from
  the virtual world which has, as of yet, not been represented outside of text.
- **Serious Game:** Games created for reasons other than pure entertainment.
  Unlike a simulation, serious games incorporate gameplay elements to solve
  challenges and gain deeper understanding as the game progresses. Serious games
  can potentially play well as a game in their own right, if done properly.

CHLOE provides a way for users to explore various scenarios; including solving
issues, creating new items, and having free play to explore AWS. After using
CHLOE, technical users have a visual point of reference to use when designing
complex AWS infrastructure. Non-technical users have an entertaining and
engaging way to discuss AWS with their audience that will drive further
exploration and adoption. CHLOE can abstract away the initial learning curve
that comes with adoption of new tooling and infrastructure, giving users access
to the details they need to complete a task, while increasing complexity at a
reasonable pace.

CHLOE creates short and long term learning opportunities through the use of
"world event"-style missions, levels, and story acts. Each activity is rewarded
using a mix of virtual badges, achievements, and points/in-game currency (which
can be used to spend on customizations for CHLOE).

- Give visual/spatial learners a point of reference for development.
- Abstract away the initial learning curve of AWS.
- Visualize cloud infrastructure in a way that's never been done before.
- Give players an opportunity to solve technically challenging scenarios and
  develop their skills.
