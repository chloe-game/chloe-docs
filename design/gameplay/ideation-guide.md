# Gameplay Ideation Guide

## Introduction

Generally, you want to enter Concept Phase when you have a good understanding
of:

- The idea
- Potential business opportunity
- A product leader
- A talent team

## Concept Phase Plan

This should include a high level plan that describes what will be accomplished
and who will be required to deliver it. Typically less than 10 people over 4
months will be needed for this. It should cover key deliverables, tasks,
durations, and roles.

This plan must address:

- Game design
- Art style
- Visual targets
- Technical design
- Project plan
- Timeframes
- Launch ready KPIs
- Asset lists, pipelines, and workflows
- Staffing and outsourcing needs
- Business opportunity analysis
- Prototype Phase plan
- Risk analysis, mitigation and contingency plans
