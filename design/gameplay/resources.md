# Resource Interactions

## Group Resources

The player is able to group resources based on freeform data (example: grouping
all the frontend web servers for a web application). This information is stored
as tags on the corresponding AWS resource.

## Move Resources

The player is able to select and move resources after they have been created
either by the player or by the resource synchronization process. The positioning
data is stored locally as part of the user's save information.
