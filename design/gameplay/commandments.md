# Commandments for Game Play

## Show the goal

It's not fun trying to figure out what you have to do.

## Problems, not puzzles

It's an obstacle course, not a jigsaw puzzle. The player should never have to
read the designer's mind.

## No forced failures

Failure is not fun. Players should have a chance to react.

## It's "role", not "roll"

It's about playing a role, not rolling the dice.

## Players Do, NPC's Don't

If something is cool, don't let the NPC do it, let the player do it. NPCs watch
the player do the cool stuff.

## Constant rewards drive players forward

You have to reward players regularly.

## Smarter players, harder games

As the player gets better, make the game harder.

## Think 3D

A 3D map can't be laid out on graph paper. If the players aren't looking up and
down, you might as well make a 2D game.

## Be connected

Tunnels that go from A to B are not interesting spaces. Instead, use highly
interconnected spaces (horizontally and vertically). Locations that have many
entrances and exit points are more engaging.

## Multiple solutions

Make sure every problem has multiple solutions

## What are the things players can do that are not directed by the game?

- Look for loops that players may create on their own; players are creative and
  will think up their own games within the game. Encourage these self-directed
  activities.
- Players being able to communicate is key.

### What kind of game variants can players create on their own?

Emergent, sticky, self-directed gameplay loops.

## Anything to give the player a stake in their world is a good reward

UI, Gear, Stickers, etc.

## What can the player do to affect change?

- Grow a dead, empty space.
- Fill a trophy room.

## How can players share their achievements?

Reciprocal gifting.

## The ride-along (CHLOE) can't be overbearing or annoying

- She should help build the space and drive narrative.
- She should fill in space mentally.
- She should empathize with the player.
- Players should be able to summon/dismiss the ride-along.
