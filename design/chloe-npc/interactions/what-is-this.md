# What is this?

When holding a resource entity, the user can choose this option to see and/or
hear and explanation of what the resource is, what purpose it serves, and how
customers are using it on AWS. This can be presented in a number of ways,
including streaming video, text, or audio. The initial effort will focus on
streaming a related video from the AWS YouTube channel. Should this introduce
delays, we can store needed content as part of the application installation.
