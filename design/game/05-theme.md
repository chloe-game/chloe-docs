# Theme and Design

CHLOE will borrow visual and audio characteristics from
[Synthwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthwave) and
[Vaporwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave) in both color and sound. As
described in their corresponding links, characteristics from each genre that
will be prevalent in CHLOE include the following.

## Personality

A common trend in our industry is a constant sense of
[impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). The last
thing I want is for CHLOE to make a player feel stupid. CHLOE demonstrates
confidence without being patronizing or smug. As a learning/simulation tool,
CHLOE adheres to the philosophy that learners want to be enabled without being
made to feel like they are not learning fast enough, or are not capable of
performing the task at hand. This is not to say CHLOE will lack challenge, the
concepts being taught range from introductory to deeply technical, and will
increase in complexity and depth as the user gains more cloud experience.

- The in-game assistant, CHLOE, is a companion character that will dialog with
  the user in different contexts to provide meaningful information/resources in
  a lighthearted manner.
- CHLOE will inject humor/quirk where appropriate to provide an entertaining
  setting for the gameplay experience. The overall style is snarky and
  self-deprecating, with the goal of entertaining the player without affecting
  personal development/empowerment.
- In Simulation Mode, described later, such humor/quirk characteristics are
  reduced/removed. The goal of Simulation Mode is to provide an infrastructure
  management and visualization tool, not so much a gameplay experience.

## Visual Characteristics

- [Glitch Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art)
  - Things break in AWS...constantly. Glitch Art is a visually interesting
    approach to call these things out.
- [Synthwave Art](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?rs=ac&len=2&q=synthwave%20art&eq=synthwave&etslf=3827&term_meta%5B%5D=synthwave%7Cautocomplete%7C0&term_meta%5B%5D=art%7Cautocomplete%7C0)
- Neon
- Gridlines
- Environment
  - The world is open and flat, to allow for freedom of movement and positioning
    of resources.
  - This also emphasizes the expansive nature and potential of AWS.
  - In video game design, completely open worlds are potentially overwhelming
    for the player. The purpose of doing so in CHLOE is to represent AWS as an
    empty canvas on which the player can build their own world.

## Audio Characteristics

The audio style of CHLOE will be slower-paced and low volume. The purpose of the
music within the simulation is to serve more as background than to contribute
significantly to the mood or story. High-repetition, instrumental music will
help to focus the user on the task at hand without distraction.

For the same purpose, as well as avoiding localization issues, recorded vocals
will not be included. The only speaking character, CHLOE, will be implemented
using subtitles, with localization done with
[Amazon Translate](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/) (stretch goal after
initial release).

The main character will not be voiced. This is a common design strategy in games
where the goal is for the player to feel more like the main character. A
character's personality predicates their voice, which has the potential to
alienate players who do not align with that personality. Subtitles are used
instead of voice for "spoken" sections of the game.
