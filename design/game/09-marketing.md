# Marketing

CHLOE will be marketed as a training tool and visual simulation platform.
Primary avenues of marketing will be conferences/trade shows (demo booths,
workshop sessions, etc.), player meetings, and streaming media (Twitch/YouTube).

For marketing via specific events, unique avatar customization rewards can be
provided. For example, redeemable codes for unique meshes for CHLOE that would
transform her into new forms/animals.
