# Team Tenets

## Engagement Drives Learning

CHLOE is meant to educate AWS learners by creating an engaging experience that
injects learning as seamlessly as possible into the gameplay experience. CHLOE
is not successful if customers feel like gameplay and learning are disjointed.

## Customer Voice Has Impact

Customers should feel like their voice has impact and measure; they should never
feel like they are "screaming into the void." From initial contact to closure,
we will strive to keep lines of communication open with customers who provide
actionable feedback.

## Reduce Barriers for Entry

CHLOE cannot be designed for high-end gaming computers with the latest graphics
cards and VR equipment. Design decisions should be made to support both everyday
learners on corporate-issued laptops and gamers with best-in-breed hardware.

## Avoid Training Traps

CHLOE is an inherently strange project. We must learn and analyze what does and
does not work in existing technical training, and game-based learning in
general. We can't shy away from trying something new just because that isn't how
people do it currently.

## Be Contextually Aware

There are many existing options for role-based training. CHLOE must remain laser
focused on training that takes place while the user is working. If we provide
training and recommendations that do not closely match what the user is doing at
that point in time, people wonâ€™t enjoy the experience.
