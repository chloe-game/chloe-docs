# Reliability Pillar

The Reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its
intended function correctly and consistently when it\u2019s expected to. This
includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total
lifecycle. You can find prescriptive guidance on implementation in the
[Reliability Pillar whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Reliability-Pillar.pdf).

There are five design principles for reliability in the cloud:

- Automatically recover from failure
- Test recovery procedures
- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
- Stop guessing capacity
- Manage change in automation
