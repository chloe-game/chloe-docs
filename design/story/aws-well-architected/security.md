# Security Pillar

The Security pillar includes the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to
take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security. You can find
prescriptive guidance on implementation in the
[Security Pillar whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Security-Pillar.pdf).

There are seven design principles for security in the cloud:

- Implement a strong identity foundation
- Enable traceability
- Apply security at all layers
- Automate security best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest
- Keep people away from data
- Prepare for security events
