# Cost Optimization Pillar

The Cost Optimization pillar includes the ability to run systems to deliver
business value at the lowest price point. You can find prescriptive guidance on
implementation in the
[Cost Optimization Pillar whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Cost-Optimization-Pillar.pdf).

There are five design principles for cost optimization in the cloud:

- Implement cloud financial management
- Adopt a consumption model
- Measure overall efficiency
- Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
- Analyze and attribute expenditure
