# Performance Efficiency Pillar

The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the ability to use computing
resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that
efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. You can find prescriptive
guidance on implementation in the
[Performance Efficiency Pillar whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Performance-Efficiency-Pillar.pdf).

There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the cloud:

- Democratize advanced technologies
- Go global in minutes
- Use serverless architectures
- Experiment more often
- Consider mechanical sympathy
