# Sustainability Pillar

The Sustainability Pillar includes design principles and operational guidance,
as well as architectural and software patterns.

The design principles will facilitate good design for sustainability:

- Understand your impact – Measure business outcomes and the related
  sustainability impact to establish performance indicators, evaluate
  improvements, and estimate the impact of proposed changes over time.
- Establish sustainability goals – Set long-term goals for each workload, model
  return on investment (ROI) and give owners the resources to invest in
  sustainability goals. Plan for growth and design your architecture to reduce
  the impact per unit of work such as per user or per operation.
- Maximize utilization – Right size each workload to maximize the energy
  efficiency of the underlying hardware, and minimize idle resources.
- Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings –
  Support upstream improvements by your partners, continually evaluate hardware
  and software choices for efficiencies, and design for flexibility to adopt new
  technologies over time.
- Use managed services – Shared services reduce the amount of infrastructure
  needed to support a broad range of workloads. Leverage managed services to
  help minimize your impact and automate sustainability best practices such as
  moving infrequent accessed data to cold storage and adjusting compute
  capacity.
- Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads – Reduce the amount of
  energy or resources required to use your services and reduce the need for your
  customers to upgrade their devices; test using device farms to measure impact
  and test directly with customers to understand the actual impact on them.
