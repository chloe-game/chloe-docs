# Operational Excellence Pillar

The Operational Excellence pillar includes the ability to support development
and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operation, and
continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to delivery business
value. You can find prescriptive guidance on implementation in the
[Operational Excellence Pillar whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Operational-Excellence-Pillar.pdf).

There are five design principles for operational excellence in the cloud:

- Perform operations as code
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes
- Refine operations procedures frequently
- Anticipate failure
- Learn from all operational failures

Boss idea: turtle that slows down workloads. Need to configure performance
monitoring to find and fix.
